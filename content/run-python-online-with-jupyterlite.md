This YouTube video introduces our new [interactive Python site](https://jupyter.codesolid.com/lab/index.html?path=index.ipynb). (You can also get there from any page via the "Online Python" link in the menu.)

Finally, to learn more about how we built this site, see [Jupyter Lite: Python in the Browser with Serverless Jupyter](https://codesolid.com/jupyter-lite-python-in-the-browser-with-serverless-jupyter/).
