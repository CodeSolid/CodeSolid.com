Hi everyone,

CodeSolid is looking for one or two new writers who can write original, well-structured articles on different Python topics. We generally publish long-form articles, often two-thousand words or more, depending on the subject. We pay $.05 per word US, so as a rule, that works out to more than $100 per article.

We're looking for programmers who can structure their ideas well -- even some with little or no paid work experience. If you've just done "SEO content writing" about some non-code topics, that won't work. We'll ask you to show something demonstrating your work (a sample article, some code you're proud of with a well-structured README, etc.).
Being able to provide a companion Jupyter Notebook with code is a plus, but not required.

All articles must be unique and not published elsewhere.

To apply or learn more, please use the Contact Form.
