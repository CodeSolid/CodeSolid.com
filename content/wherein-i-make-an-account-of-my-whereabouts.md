One of the conceits of being a blogger is imagining that someone will notice if we are absent for a time. Another is that those folks, missing you as they do, would want you to tell you what you've been up to -- even if it has nothing to do with the usual themes of the blog.

So here's what I've been doing, in no particular order:

- I've decided that, independently of whatever else I might want to learn, I can make up my own university course. To make up such a course, you need to schedule and spend a certain amount of time on something you don't know, digging into the subject in whatever way seems appropriate to you. For a three-credit-hour course, based on some averages I found for in-class and out-of-class time, this amounts to spending eight hours per week for fifteen weeks for a science course or 10 2/3 hours per week for fifteen weeks for a science course. Here are [the calculations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WWABf31tX2N0ZBmIAxVFI0a3zNQDCHoIs1kGUFTJYgU/edit?usp=sharing "the calculations") that led to this result.  
      
    For my first representative experiment, I'm using [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAqxyLRa5Uk) of podcast learning for languages coupled with [RadioAmbulante](https://radioambulante.org/)'s excellent Spanish Podcast, and I'm currently completing week two of something I'm calling Spanish 301. The background is that I already speak Spanish well enough that native speakers will treat me to a wall of sound if I talk to them, so I need more practice processing that wall of sound.  
    

- I have begun a modest Rust blog. I won't link to it now because -- as I mentioned -- it's modest so far, but more to the point, I will likely shut it down after migrating its existing articles here. It's clear that my output has dipped a bit lately, so insofar as I'm writing fewer articles, it makes no sense to host that in more than one place. I am, after all, a generalist, and if the search engines penalize that, they do, but I eschew frittering my life away on that concern.  
    

- In addition to Rust, I've spent some time in the unorganized primordial goo of C and C++ "build tools." For example, I spent a couple of days fighting on a Mac with the fact that what Brew does and what `make install` does are entirely separate and unrelated to each other. Even setting aside Cargo -- which just works -- those who complain about the relentless parade of Python packaging tools don't know how good they have it compared to the arcane, undocumented voodoo mishmash of C and C++.  
    

- So what was I doing there in C++ besides complaining about my spinning wheels? Well, I was trying to build a tutorial for wxWidgets, because I've recently gotten interested in what folks are doing to build cross-platform apps. Yes, I got it working after a while and perhaps should have spun an article out of it, but I don't really want to get deeper into a world that I knew would come to thwart me even more ungraciously on Windows. Meantime, a less mature (perhaps) though already more tractable tool turned out to be Rust's [Slint](https://slint.rs/ "Slint"), which was up and running in a matter of a few minutes, as it should be. Finally, apps like Joplin, which I really love, get along just fine on React Native.  
    

- I have spent some time revisiting the recovery meetings that I encountered almost forty years ago, as well as attending some [new ones online](https://www.worldwidesecularmeetings.com/meetings) and convening an in-person [LifeRing meeting in Charlotte.](https://www.meetup.com/secular-alcoholism-addiction-recovery-group-lifering/)

So there you have my hodge-podge of things that have been distracting me from this lovely Python blog.
