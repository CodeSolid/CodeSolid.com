<h1>On Being The World’s Oldest Math Major<a class="headerlink" href="#on-being-the-world-s-oldest-math-major" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Before I begin to tell you why I fancy myself the world’s oldest math major, a couple of disclaimers are in order</p>
<p>First, although I have undergraduate and graduate degrees in non-Math subjects, I’m technically a visiting student at the local community college. So, if you object to someone non-matriculated declaring a major, you may feel I haven’t lived up to your expectations.</p>
<p>The second disclaimer here is that I haven’t gone out and scoured the world’s universities to see if some old codger, older and codgerlier than me, is working toward a math degree.  So it’s not like I can give you a proof – and certainly not a mathematical one – that I’m the world’s oldest math major.</p>
<p>Consider it an axiom.</p>
<p>As I write this, I’m 64 years old.  It’s 2024, and I’ve just taken my first major exam in Calculus 1. Some 40 years have elapsed since I took pre-calculus, so needless to say, I had to brush up on a few fundamentals first.</p>
<p>At 64, my Calculus-for-credit adventure begins. This same year, I will become eligible for Medicare.</p>
<p>To-may-to, to-mah-to.</p>
<p>Assuming I don’t run out of money, my career as a software developer is behind me.  I didn’t study Computer Science in school, partly because I was talked out of it by a well-meaning but ignorant Humanities teacher.</p>
<p>Even more to the point, Calculus was a pre-requisite for a Computer Science degree, and there was no way I was taking that. I saw other people taking it because they had to – and they didn’t look too happy about it.  Moreover, though I was once good at math, I felt my High School algebra teacher had traumatized me enough. Finally, there was the delicate business of maintaining a good GPA while over-indulging in partying and other young adult shenanigans.</p>
<p>So, this year, I finally did it. No more brushing things up.  No more pressure-free, panty-waist YouTube Calculus for me. Today, I face the beast, armed only with my wits, several hundred sheets of three-hole graph paper, and my shiny new TI-84+ calculator.</p>
<p>That calculator, by the way, was responsible for a significant portion of the learning curve in the first few days. TWO minus signs? What’s up with that?</p>
<p>Nothing that the world’s oldest math major can’t handle.</p>
<p>The test results are in. Including the bonus question, I scored 103 points on a 100-point scale.</p>
<p>Not bad for an old guy.</p>
