    "# Using Desmos Graphs in Jupyter Notebooks\n",

    "OK -- I went another way in this article and got something to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the beginning of what was to be the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently finished Calculus I as the [World's Oldest Math Major](/worlds-oldest-math-major). In class and on exams, I had the pleasure of competing with people a third my age in hunting and pecking on a TI-84 calculator. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, at home, I only spent as much time as I needed on that device to do well on exams.  Instead, my preferred tools for calculation and graphing were a Python stack consisting of an open IPython terminal with SymPy installed and a browser opened to [https://www.desmos.com/calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) for graphing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I love SymPy for undergraduate math. It has everything I need to quickly try things out to refresh my memory, or to double-check the answers I found manually before submitting them to the online homework portal.  Although I've learned enough of it to be dangerous, one tool that's not a great fit for a busy semester is matplotlib, Python's most popular plotting library.  Although its website boasts that \"Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible,\" I find I can agree with only the latter part of that claim.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For spinning up a quick graph to check a result, for example, doing this in Matplotlib would take me probably five times as long as it would in Desmos.  (If I did it all the time, I could probably cut that down to three times as long, but that's still not great).\n"
