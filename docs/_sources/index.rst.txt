CodeSolid features articles at the intersection of Math and Programming.  It is written by a retired programmer who fancies himself `The World's Oldest Math Major <./worlds-oldest-math-major>`_.

As you can see from the category headings on the left, you can find a lot on this site about Python, with a smattering of C, C++, Docker, and other software engineering topics. Going forward we still expect to do some of that, especially as it relates to mathematics.

Sometimes those relationships can be pretty tenuous and in the nature of early experiments, such as when `Euclid meets SymPy </math/sympy_geometry>`_.  No one including me saw that one coming, but it was a pleasant diversion when it did arrive.
