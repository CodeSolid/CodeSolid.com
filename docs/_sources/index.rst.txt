CodeSolid features articles on a number of topics in applied math, Python, Jupyter and other math software tools.  

Since our editor and main contributor, John Lockwood, is currently working on enough undergraduate mathematics to "tackle" quantum mechanics, we expect to occasionally spin off an article or Jupyter Notebook based on that.  

One recent contribution reviews the `Dirac Notation for Complex Inner Products and How to Implement that in Python <complex-inner-products>`_.
