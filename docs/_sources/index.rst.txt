CodeSolid features articles on a number of topics in applied math, Python, Jupyter.  

Since our editor and main conributor, John Lockwood, is currently working on enough undergraduate mathematics to "tackle" quantum mechanics, we expect to occasionally spin off an article or Jupyter Notebook based on that.  

One recent contribution reviews the `Dirac Notation for Complex Inner Products and How to Implement that in Python <complex-inner-products>`_.
