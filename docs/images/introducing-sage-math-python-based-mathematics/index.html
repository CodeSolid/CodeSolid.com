  <p>SageMath, sometimes called Sage, is a free, open mathematics software package with the mission of “<em>Creating a viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica and Matlab</em>.” In other words, it is a computer algebra system, allowing you to do symbolic math in the same way you might work it out on paper.</p>
<p>In this article, I want to briefly introduce Sage from the point of view of someone who’s spent far more time developing and using software than he has doing mathematics. In addition to a high-level overview, I wanted to share some tips and issues I ran into when installing it, the solution to these issues, and ways you can get started online.</p>
<p>Because it’s written in Python, working in Sage doesn’t require learning a new, proprietary language and allows you to work with familiar tools such as Jupyter. There’s also a Sage shell if you prefer a command-line interface, but much like the combination of IPython plus Matplotlib, you can still launch plots with very little work.</p>
<p>Sage is written in Python, but it is not pure Python. Sage is a high-level tool built against over ninety open-source packages – so it has many Python and non-Python dependencies. These include Maxima (a LISP-based computer algebra system), GAP (which specializes in group theory), PARI (another computer algebra system originally incorporated into Sage for its number theory functionality), and even R for statistical computing. In addition, Sage includes interfaces to use many of these packages and many custom algorithms developed by the Sage community.</p>

<p>There are some excellent options for running SageMath online. SageMath.org, for example, hosts a free SageMathCell page that’s handy for running short experiments. Let’s try our hand at a bit of math, solving a quadratic equation. Minus the comment, this is a one-liner in Sage:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image-116.png" /></p>
<p>For more extensive work with Sage, you might prefer to create a free account on CoCalc, a commercial Jupyter, Sage, and collaborative development and teaching platform developed by William Stein, Sage’s author. CoCalc will give you access to full Sage notebooks and many other <a class="reference external" href="https://cocalc.com/features">cool features</a>. If your needs grow beyond the free account, you can upgrade for a modest monthly or yearly price, depending on how much CPU and disk space you need.</p>

<h2>Installing Sage Math On Your Machine<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-sage-math-on-your-machine" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Before we get into installing SageMath on your machine, let me point out a few caveats up front. Don’t let the talk of caveats scare you off too much, though – I did get Sage installed on my Mac. I also created a nice Docker container for it too, so I know that in Linux, installing it using the combination combination below worked well:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>RUN<span class="w"> </span>apt-get<span class="w"> </span>update
RUN<span class="w"> </span>apt-get<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>-y<span class="w"> </span>sagemath
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As for Windows, the documented approach in the official <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html">installation guide</a> is to use WSL, so presumably, that approach works well there, too.</p>
<p>Though I was able to get Sage working, there were a few things I tried that didn’t work. I realize I should probably spend some time going through those with the Sage community so I can help out in their efforts. For now, let me just note them briefly: I was unable to build SageMath from source on a Mac. (My little Mini is M1 based). In fairness, I used the main branch main instead of grabbing a release tag. On that same machine, I was also unable to get an environment working using MiniConda.</p>
<p>What did work well for me after trying these approaches was to install SageMath using a Mac <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/3-manifolds/Sage_macOS/releases">binary package</a> provided by 3-manifolds. After installing this, running the SageMath 9.6 launcher from Launchpad started a Sage tool that you can use out of the box to launch either the SageMath shell or a Sage notebook.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image-66.png" /></p>
<p>Both options worked just fine from this program, but since I’m more at home at the command line, I wanted to be able to launch <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sage</span></code> from the terminal to get the Sage shell or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sage</span> <span class="pre">--notebook</span></code> to run a sage kernel in Jupyter notebook. Doing this was a simple matter of adding this line to the file ~/.zprofile:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">export</span> <span class="pre">PATH=&quot;$PATH:/Applications/SageMath-9-6.app/Contents/Frameworks/Sage.framework/Versions/Current/venv/bin&quot;</span></code></p>
<p>In general, the Sage terminal is now my first choice for quick experiments in Sage. Here, for example, I define a function and plot it:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image-7-1024x415.png" /></p>
<p>You may have noticed two things by this point. First, you’ll see that after some false starts, I had to download and install a binary version of Sage. Sage is a non-trivial piece of software so I wouldn’t count on “pip install” for it.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are things about the code we’ve gone over so far that simply wouldn’t work in Python; Sage is mathematics software built on Python; it’s not just another Python shell.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss this theme a bit more in the next section.</p>

<section id="sage-is-python-with-a-twist">
<h1>Sage Is “Python With a Twist”<a class="headerlink" href="#sage-is-python-with-a-twist" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Whether you’re using the Notebook version of sage or the terminal program, you’ll see several differences between them and a vanilla Python shell, but there are core similarities as well that make working with Sage quite fun for Python programmers.</p>
<section id="how-sage-is-different-from-python">
<h2>How Sage Is Different From Python<a class="headerlink" href="#how-sage-is-different-from-python" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Sage has many, many more built-in functions than Python. Opening up a vanilla Python terminal, if we type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">len(dir())</span></code> to see what’s available before even doing anything, we get 7 things. Of course, a lot of good stuff in Python is in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__builtins__</span></code>, which gets resolved automatically, but even there, the number of items is 156. Running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">len(dir())</span></code> in Sage, on the other hand, returns a value of 1918 as of SageMath 9.6.</p>
<p>We see one of them in the function definition we showed earlier: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">x^3</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">4*x</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">2</span></code>. As everyone’s favorite math variable, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;x</span></code>” is defined in Sage, it’s a sage symbolic expression (an instance of sage.symbolic.expression.Expression), which incidentally is also what f ends up being once we’ve defined the function that way.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Numbers and operators sometimes do different things in Sage. Another interesting feature of the last expression is this part of it: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x^3</span></code>. The caret operator is an exponent operator in Sage, though <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">**</span></code> also works as it does in Python. In Python, there is such an operator, but it represents the little-used bitwise exclusive or (xor). Thus, 5^3 == 6 in Python, but 125 in Sage! Number literals, too, often have surprising types, as we see in this screenshot:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image-84.png" /></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Symbols everywhere! Generally speaking, for symbols like pi or for rational expressions, values are displayed in their symbolic form by default (which makes sense for software doing symbolic math). Thus, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1/5</span></code> displays as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.2</span></code> in a Python console, but remains <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1/5</span></code> in Sage, unless we explicitly divide it by casting to a float, as shown here in a Sage notebook:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image-104.png" /></p>

<section id="how-sage-and-python-are-the-same">
<h1>How Sage And Python Are The Same<a class="headerlink" href="#how-sage-and-python-are-the-same" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Even though Sage is heavily customized, when you’re working in Sage, you’re still working in an environment based on Python. Because of that, I was able to explore the Sage types using the Python <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">type()</span></code> function and compare the number of builtins using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dir()</span></code>. Python types still pop their heads up from time to time (for example, in a list comprehension based on a range, the elements will still be Python ints). Even the xor operator hasn’t been stolen from you (not that I would miss it) – you just need to type two carets instead of one.</p>
<p>If you’re a Python programmer, you’ll feel right at home using Sage once you get over some initial surprises. As Gregory Bard, the author of “Sage for Undergraduates”, wrote on his retro-styled <a class="reference external" href="http://gregorybard.com/Sage.html">Sage Related Stuff</a> page,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>If you use Sage in a mathematics, statistics, physics, or data-science class, you will learn Python along the way</em>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I would say the reverse is true, too. For those of us who are already Python programmers, we now can enjoy an environment where we can still do that <em>and</em> play with some beautiful LaTeX-formatted derivatives along the way:</p>
