    "As a beginning undergraduate in math, I really appreciate good math writing. That's why when the excellent author of [Introduction to Graph Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Graph-Theory-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486678709), Richard Trudeau, hailed [What Is Mathematics](https://www.amazon.com/What-Mathematics-Elementary-Approach-Methods-ebook/dp/B000SEKHFG) as \"one of the best all-around mathematics textbooks since Euclid,\" I recognized that as my marching orders, so I picked up a copy and began reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found this book worthwhile enough to begin working on the exercises instead of just reading through and \"skimming.\"  The supplement to chapter 1 covered Number Theory, and as soon as I began grappling with these, I wanted to try out some things in Python.  This article is just an attempt to share some of those explorations.  (I'll be doing some \"beginner explorations\" in this article.  If you're more advanced, you might consider exploring SymPy's [ntheory package](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/ntheory.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion in the What is Mathematics section on Number Theory began with the idea of congruence.  Programmers are familiar with the modulus operator, %, which gives the remainder left over after an integer division of the operands.  For example:"

    "\n",
    "_What Is Mathematics_ goes through these properties, so I won't reproduce them here, but they generate many interesting results.  For example, congruent numbers can be added and multiplied; for any given modulus, we can construct tables to understand the results. We have some day-to-day experience with doing this in mod 12, where we know that if it's 10:00 AM now, five hours from now, it won't be 15:00 (unless you're in the military).  Instead, it will be 3 PM because $15 \\bmod 12 = 3$.\n",

Thus, 27 is divisible by nine because $2 + 7 = 9$. Because we're dealing with base 10 (where the digit choices are 0-9), the remainder after division by 9 is the same as you get from the sum of a number's digits:\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $139 \\bmod 9 = 4$, and $1 + 3 + 9 = 13$.  We can see that 13 divided by nine gives a remainder of four, which we can also obtain by a second digit sum, i.e., $1 + 3 = 4$"

I therefore reasoned that the second modulus of the sequence we showed above should give us the answer:  $\\boxed{2}$.  This will turn out to be wrong, but bear with me.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check the answer in Python, I thought it was a great time to figure out how summations worked in SymPy. In general, SymPy is my go-to tool for checking results in Calculus. Now, for this problem, we'll see in a minute that that approach is a bit overengineered since Python will also get us there directly, but let's try SymPy first.\n",
