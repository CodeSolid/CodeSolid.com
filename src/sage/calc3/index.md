# Multivariable Calculus Sage Notebooks

As I write this, I am in the throes of teaching myself Multivariable Calculus (also known as "Calc 3") using one of the fine Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offered by [Phoenix College](https://www.phoenixcollege.edu/degrees-certificates/mathematics/self-study-math-moocs).  As part of this journey, I am using SageMath notebooks as my primary note-taking + problem-solving + calculator application.  Although clearly this represents a sort of "work in progress", I thought I would move these notes here to make them generally available.  This is because along the way I'm learning a great deal not only about how to do the math by hand, but how SageMath can be used in this context, and the latter may be useful to other students.

These are based on the course Calculus III MOOC (MAT24x), taught by James Sousa.  I am breaking the notes down into eight "modules" (which are just logical sections of material that I'm using to schedule my progress).

* [Vector Notes](./mod1/VectorNotesSage)
* [Vector Valued Functions](./mod2/VectorValuedFunctions)
